# Calibration

After the experiment has been conducted,
the recorded calibration videos can be used to prepare the calibration in PeTrack.
<br>
The first calibration to be performed is the intrinsic calibration, which corrects for the lens distortion of the camera.
The second calibration is the extrinsic calibration, which is performed to create known points in 3D space.
<br>
In order to perform both calibrations, the recorded video material has to be prepared before utilizing it in PeTrack.
