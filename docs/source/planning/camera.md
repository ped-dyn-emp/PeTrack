# Camera selection and parameter settings

The cameras with the corresponding lens are the centerpiece for collecting the raw data. The selection of the camera model and lens and the setting of the parameters must therefore be carried out very carefully and, if possible, tested in the planned environment. 

The aim is to determine the head trajectory of each person as accurately as possible. The perspective view of a camera can occlude people from each other or from the structures. The vertical view on a crowd of people from above minimizes occlusion. A large focal length or a small angle of view further reduce the negative influence of the perspective view. To cover the experimental area, the mounting height must be increased if the angle of view is reduced. The greater the difference in size, the greater the occlusion, so that it may make sense to limit the subject acquisition to a range of person sizes.
