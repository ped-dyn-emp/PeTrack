# Location
Depending on the research question, an appropriate location must be found. 
Hereby, the size of the experimental area should be considered as well as 
the maximum possible camera view. This is again, dependent on the ceiling 
height and the camera mounting possibilities of that location. Furthermore, 
the appearance of the floor is important. On the one hand, prominent colors 
of the floor should be noted and avoided during the further planning of the 
experiments (participant clothing, calibration markers). On the other hand, 
the suitability of the floor to cope with adhesive tape should be discussed, 
to ensure easy preparation of the [calibration process](/calibration.md)
For camera recordings it is important to have sufficient light illuminate the
entire scene in a uniform manner. The light should be as bright as possible
without influencing the experiment. If possible sunlight should be blocked 
out to avoid bright spots in the experimental area throughout the day.

:::{Note}
If you are planning to include a not planar area in your experiment
(e.g. stairs), keep in mind that more elaborate technical sensors might be 
necessary for the collection of accurate data (e.g. stereo cameras).
