# Data Preparation for PeTrack

After you have completed the experiments, it is helpful to prepare the data 
before using PeTrack.

It can be helpful to cut the recorded videos to approximately experiment 
length. Hereby, it is not recommended to have videos exceeding 15 minutes, 
since it will slow down the software.

After preparing the data, download the newest version of 
[PeTrack](https://petrack.readthedocs.io) and start following our [software 
tutorial](/getting_started.md).
