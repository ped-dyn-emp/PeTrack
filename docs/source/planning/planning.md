When planning to work with PeTrack to extract trajectories from videos, 
the planned experiments should be performed within a suitable setup to 
ensure good quality results. The following text should give an overview of 
recommendations, which ensure the proper settings so that PeTrack can be 
used successfully.

These include recommendations about
- [Experiment Location](location.md)
- [Technical Equipment](technical_equipment.md)
