# Experiment workflow

- Prepare surrounding:
  - Position constructions
  - Place marker on ground for extrinsic calibration
- Prepare cameras on ground: 
  - Battery or external power supply
  - Storage media 
  - Camera parameter settings
  - Manual focus to head distance
  - Recordings for intrinsic calibration
- Mount cameras:
  - Protection against falling
  - Adjust and orient
  - Recordings for extrinsic calibration
- During experiment:
  - Record full day or single experiments
  - Time synchronization between experimental runs
  - Write down real time schedule and incidents
- After experiment:
  - Store and backup video footage
