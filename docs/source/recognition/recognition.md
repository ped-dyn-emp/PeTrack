# Recognition

It is possible to use PeTrack to do semi-automatic tracking. That means, one does detect the pedestrians manually and then tracks these automatically. However, it is faster, potentially more accurate and more convenient to let PeTrack handle the detection of pedestrians automatically. For this purpose, the pedestrians usually get a _marker_. That is some kind of special hat, which then gets detected from PeTrack.

While there are a plethora of options available, we suggest using the multicolor or code markers. Please see their respective sites for more information.
