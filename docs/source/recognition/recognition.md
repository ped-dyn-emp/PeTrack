# Recognition

PeTrack can detect the pedestrians using _markers_. That is some special kind of hat. These hats are designed to be detected by the software algorithmically, after the user sets the necessary parameters. 
While there are plenty of options available, we suggest using the multicolor or code markers, since they are the current State of the Art. Please see their respective sites for more information.
