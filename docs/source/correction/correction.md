# Correction
After all the videos are automatically tracked, you will have to go back and correct the trajectories by hand. This is necessary to ensure data quality. 
Therefore, you have to check that:
* all pedestrians in the video are tracked,
* each pedestrian is only tracked once,
* trajectories are complete and not split in several parts,
* only pedestrians participating in the experiment are tracked,
* the head of the participant is tracked with sufficient accuracy,
* ...


Depending on the kind of experiment and the quality of the tracking, the necessary steps for a manual correction might differ. A suggested Correction Workflow and the possible operations are explained. Several very common mistakes can be identified by predefined tests in the Correction tab.


- When do we do it? (e.g. have you already tuned the parameters first?)
