/**
 * Custom Slider-class that changes scrolling behaviour and adds a throttling option.
 *
 * To prevent an unwanted change in value when scrolling on the UI, this custom
 * implementation of the Slider only scrolls, if it has focus.
 * To throttle the amount of updates during a mouse event this slider has a custom throttling system
 * that only sends signals when a timer has run out.
 * This implementation keeps proper handling of keyboard navigation and fixes track clicks */
