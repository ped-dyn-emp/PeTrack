# Contributing to PeTrack

Thanks for your interest in contributing to PeTrack. There are different ways to contribute.

## Report bugs or propose features

If you want to report a bug or propose a new feature, please [open an issue](https://go.fzj.de/petrack-new-issue) in our GitLab repo. 

For reporting a bug, please note the version of PeTrack you are using and steps to reproduce the issue.

## Contribute to Documentation

We document PeTrack on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/). The documentation is contained in the `docs` subdirectory of this repository. To propose a change in the documentation, you can open a PR on GitHub. Ideally, you also open an issue, since internally we mainly develop on GitLab. That way you can make sure we see your contribution. Please see the documentation at https://petrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/documentation.html for how to set up a local build of the documentation web page.

## Contribute to code

If you want to contribute to the code, we recommend you open an issue beforehand so we can discuss the desired change. 

We are hosted on https://jugit.fz-juelich.de, but this GitLab instance does not allow new users to create new projects. Therefore, we accept contributions via GitHub and mirror the PR to our GitLab instance. 

TL;DR Create a PR on GitHub, as if we were hosted there and we'll do the rest.

For general information on coding guidelines or how to create a dev environment please consult the documentation at https://petrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/code_contribution/code.html
