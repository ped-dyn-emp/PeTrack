/**
 * @brief struct used for storing intrinsic camera params.
 *
 * Central place to store this information and easier passing in methods.
 * Using value semantics.
 *
 * This struct includes the camera matrix from the pinhole camera model, which looks as follows
 *     [fx 0 cx
 *      0 fy cy
 *      0  0  1]
 * Note the 0 in the middle of the first row is an assumption made in OpenCV.
 * The skewness is always set to zero.
 *
 * It also includes the distortion parameters, which are regressed parameters of a distortion model
 * used to undistort the image into an image on which the pinhole camera is a good model.
 *
 * @warning cv::Mat only does shallow copies. If you set the member of this class, use cv::Mat::clone
