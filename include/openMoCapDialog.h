/**
 * @brief The OpenMoCapDialog class is the dialog when opening a MoCap file (i.e. c3d)
 *
 * This class is the logic behind the dialog opening a motion capture file. It asks for
 * some additional information (e.g. time offset) and validates them as good as possible
 * (e.g. negative sample rate is impossible). Filepath, Offset and Samplerate are saved in MoCapController.
 * The actual reading is implemented in IO::readMoCapC3D.
