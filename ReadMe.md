For the understanding of the dynamics inside crowds reliable empirical data are needed enabling an increase of safety and comfort for pedestrians and the design of models reflecting the real dynamics. PeTrack (**Pe**destrian **Track**ing) automatically extracts accurate trajectories of marked pedestrians from video recordings. The joint trajectories of all pedestrians provide data like velocity, flow and density at any time and position. With such a tool extensive experimental series with a large number of persons can be analyzed. Individual codes enables personalized trajectories with static information of each participant (e.g. age, gender).

The program deals with wide angle lenses and a high density of pedestrians. Lens distortion and perspective view are taken into account. The procedure includes calibration, recognition, tracking and height detection.
Different kinds of markers (e.g. with height information, head direction, individual code) are implemented. With a stereo camera more accurate height measurements and also markerless tracking is possible.


## Download & installation:
We publish installers for windows. To get the latest installer, visit this
[webpage](https://go.fzj.de/petrack-download) and download the current installer. 

## How to use PeTrack

To learn how to use PeTrack, please have a look at our documentation [here](https://petrack.readthedocs.io/). 

> Note that PeTrack can only be used if some steps are considered **during the planning and execution of the experiments**. This includes, but is not limited to, calibration and selecting hats. See [Planning of Experiments](https://petrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/planning/planning.html)

After all of that, enjoy successful recognition and tracking ðŸ˜ƒ

Some documentation is built into PeTrack itself. For example, you can use the `help`-menu to find a list of all keybindings. For running in a "batch-mode", PeTrack has a CLI, whose options are listed by calling
```bash
petrack -help
```

## Tutorial & demo
A small demo project is provided in the `demo` folder. It contains all necessary
files for setting up a project with PeTrack. You can download these files via
[this link](https://go.fzj.de/petrack-demo-download). A tutorial leading through
all steps can be found in the
[Documentation](https://petrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).
The intermediate project files for each step are also included in the `demo`
folder.
